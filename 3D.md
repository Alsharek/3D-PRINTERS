# 3D PRINTERS 
### Beside these printers so usful , its so much fun in same time , Here i wil expalin you fast how you can start print 3D models even if you have zero knoldage about working with 3D softwears:
**BLENDER** , **CREO**,
 **FUSION**                 **SOLIDWORK** ....

# TYPES OF 3D PRINTERS
### In simple way i can say there is two you can foucs on, Depends on what kind of work you want to do with,I will explain you each one and i will leave the choose for you !

# STL 3D PRINTER 
### This kind of printer is the easy one to start with for main reasons
1. you can find cheap one.
2. the filment that you use is not dangours chimical metraial. 
3. No need to buy extra devices to finsh your model.
### All you need is two main things:
* The printer 
* STL Filament [the plastic metral that the printer use]
### all what left to do is to take the design you made or the one you can find online and put inside the printer by diffrent methods:
* USB FLASH DRIVE
* CABEL FROM PC TO THE PRINTER.
* CLOUD NETWERK FROM INSIDE THE PRINTER

# RESIN 3D PRINTER
### With all the good sides the stl printer has , but if you want to make your model more higher resloution , Then it is the time to switch to resin printers , but with higher quilety come higher spending money you may find the printer in afordibal price but yet , You still need to buy extra things and become more carful in how to use the chimical metrals **Wearing mask and work with resin is important to protect your self from the chimical dust not only corona ;D , It is important not to inhale the resin dust, which could potentially cause an allergic reaction**
## Resin printers perfect to print out Figures more than the STL for the quality it offers

# Print now !
### Now you know what printer to buy , so its the time to move and let the Action start ! if you know how to work with 3D softwears thats good but yet even if you have zero knowladge about how to design , You still can print with help of the websites i will provied you now.

# WEBSITES 
### I will list you the link of two best websites to work with one of them you search for what you want and you download what you need , the other one you can desgin your model by only using your browser and so simple 
## 1- Thingiverse 
### Here you can find alot of models ready to download and be printed
